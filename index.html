        <h2>What is Library Socialism?</h2>

        <p>
            <a href="https://medium.com/@wrong_shon/the-basics-of-library-socialism-wip-1c3f00a7c94f">Library Socialism</a>
            is a movement which uses the lending library as a model for how we can
            meet societies needs in democratic and ecological ways.
        </p>

        <p>
            In a typical <strong>lending library</strong>, the community collectively owns books and those books
            are available to their members free of charge. This increases public access to books
            and reduces the total number of books that need to be printed.
        </p>

        <p>
            In a <strong>library of things</strong>, communities can collectively own all sorts of objects
            from home and garden tools to kitchen appliances to exercise equipmentâ€¦ and make them available
            to their members free of charge. Just like in the case of a typical lending library,
            people have access to more while consuming less.
        </p>

        <h2>What is <span class="typewriter">usufruct.dev</span>?</h2>
        
        <p>
            The <span class="typewriter">usufruct.dev</span> project is aimed at building Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
            to help communities manage their collective resources and help community members access them.
            The project is named after the term usufruct, which refers to the right to use and benefit
            from but not destroy, and is a principle of Library Socialism.
        </p>

        <h2>Federation</h2>

        <p>
            Instead of trying to create one Mega-Platform, <span class="typewriter">usufruct.dev</span>
            will enable communities to self-host their own instances. That way communities have the freedom
            to run their libraries however they want and own their data.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This is similar to how the Mastodon project creates and maintains software that is self-hosted
            by different instances that all share the same core protocol.
        </p>

        <p>
            These community instances will have control over
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>What kinds of items are in their library</li>
            <li>Where and how those items are stored</li>
            <li>How they prevent and manage abuse</li>
            <li>When and how items are loaned to other libraries</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How do I get involved?</h2>

        <p>
            For the project to succeed, we'll need help from many groups of people.
        </p>

        </p>

        <p>
            However, software that is ready to use or even test is a long way off and we're not quite ready to
            work with you yet.
